#Low level programming C
> 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

> Resources
- Read extensively on the following topics

~ Understanding C program Compilation Process
~ Object-like Macros
~ Macro Arguments
~ Pre Processor Directives in C
~ The C Preprocessor
~ Standard Predefined Macros
~ include guard
~ Common Predefined Macros

> Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

> General
- What are macros and how to use them
- What are the most common predefined macros
- How to include guard your header files.

Tasks
0. Object-like Macro: Creates a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
1. Pi: Creates a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
2. File name: Writes a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
3. Function-like macro: Writes a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
4. SUM: Writes a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
