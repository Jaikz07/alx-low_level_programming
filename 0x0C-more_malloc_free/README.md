0x0C. C - More malloc, free.
C - Memory allocation.

> Concepts:
- Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free.

> Resources:
Read extensively on "Do I cast the result of malloc?" and use the man or help command line of the followingin your Git-bash:
- exit (3)
- calloc
- realloc

> Learning objectives
better understanding of the concept and ability to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

> General
How to use the exit function
What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them.

Tasks
0. Trust no one: a function that allocates memory using malloc
1. string_nconcat: a function that concatenates two strings.
2. _calloc: a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
3. array_range: a function that creates an array of integers.
4. _realloc: a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope: a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
